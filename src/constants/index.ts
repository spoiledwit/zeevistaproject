    slogan: "Your Trusted Mainland Company Setup Partner",
    content: `
        <p>What exactly is a UAE mainland company and why is it so important to have one? A mainland company is a company licensed by the Department of Economic Development (DED) in the relevant Emirate of the United Arab Emirates. Here’s a summary of the benefits of company registration on the UAE mainland, plus a guide to business setup on the Dubai mainland!</p>
        
        <h2>Benefits of Mainland Company Formation in Dubai</h2>
        <p>Setting up a mainland company in Dubai comes with many advantages. Here are some key benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wider Business Opportunities:</strong> Mainland companies can trade anywhere in Dubai and across the UAE, giving you access to a larger market.</li>
          <li><strong>Full Ownership:</strong> You can have 100% ownership of your business, providing you with full control and flexibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible Locations:</strong> Choose from various locations to set up your business, allowing you to find the best spot for your needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These benefits make mainland company formation an attractive option for entrepreneurs looking to grow and succeed.</p>
  
        <h2>Location Flexibility and Zero Trade Restrictions</h2>
        <p>With a Dubai mainland company, you can trade freely with other businesses and have unlimited location options. These companies can also offer services to the government and sell directly to consumers anywhere in the UAE. Plus, setting up a mainland company allows you to open multiple branches, establishing a strong presence throughout the Emirates.</p>
  
        <h2>Broad Working Scope</h2>
        <p>Mainland businesses can take on a wide range of work. If you want to diversify your services within the mainland, simply re-register the new business activity with the DED, and you can start trading freely.</p>
  
        <h2>Access to Lucrative Government Contracts</h2>
        <p>A large incentive to set up a mainland business in Dubai is the access to valuable government contracts in the UAE. In recent years, the Abu Dhabi Executive Council approved AED 17.5bn (USD 4.76bn) of spending on government projects, including over AED 4bn on infrastructure. As an established mainland company in Dubai, you’ll be well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
  
        <h2>100% Ownership Control of Mainland Business Entities</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, 100% foreign ownership of a UAE business entity was only possible under two circumstances: when setting up in a free zone or when establishing a professional services company in the mainland. However, recent changes allow 100% foreign ownership of mainland companies in the UAE, opening up incredible potential for international investors, except for certain strategic sectors such as oil and gas.</p>
  
        <h2>Switching from Free Zone to Mainland Company Formation in Dubai</h2>
        <p>If you’re currently operating within a free zone business structure and considering transitioning to a mainland company, we’re here to assist you. This switch is vital for your business’s growth. With the right UAE national sponsor or company formation specialist, moving from a free zone to the mainland is both a strategic and manageable decision.</p>
  
        <h2>Your Checklist for Mainland Business Setup in Dubai</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Choose Your Business Activity:</strong> The first step is selecting the industry in which you will trade. There are over 2000 permitted business activities listed by the DED, including trading, agriculture, hospitality, and manufacturing.</li>
          <li><strong>Find the Ideal Location for Your Business:</strong> Mainland businesses face no restrictions on where they can set up. Choose a location based on budgeting and business activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Determine Your Business Legal Structure:</strong> Most mainland companies are set up as Limited Liability Companies (LLCs). Professional services companies can be 100% foreign-owned.</li>
          <li><strong>Obtain a Local Sponsor or Local Service Agent:</strong> An LLC requires a local sponsor, who will own 51% of the business. However, a local service agent is needed for professional service companies, without any share ownership.</li>
          <li><strong>Name Your Company:</strong> Ensure your company name follows UAE regulations regarding language, cultural sensitivity, and personal names.</li>
          <li><strong>Apply for a Mainland Trade License:</strong> Submit the necessary documents to the DED to acquire your business license.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Your Office Space:</strong> Choose between serviced offices or shell and core options based on your business needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Apply for Relevant Visas:</strong> Apply for visas for yourself, employees, and dependents. The number of visas depends on your office space.</li>
          <li><strong>Partner with a Company Setup Consultant:</strong> Working with UAE-based business setup consultants ensures a smooth and compliant company formation process.</li>
        </ol>
