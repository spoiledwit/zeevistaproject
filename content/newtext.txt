<p >Citizenship by Investment Dominica</p> <p >The <strong>Dominica Economic Citizenship Program</strong> legally offers individuals and families worldwide an irrevocable second citizenship and passport in only four to six months with no visit to the country required. The Caribbean island nation has an excellent international reputation, and consequently, the Commonwealth of Dominica passport provides visa-free or visa on arrival access to more than 115 countries around the world including the entire European Union, Switzerland, UK, Singapore, Russia, Brazil, and Hong Kong. The Dominica citizenship through investment program is legally entrenched in law, and since local law does not contain any restrictions on holding dual nationality, obtaining second citizenship by investment in the country is a confidential process that does not require a person to renounce their existing citizenship.</p> <p ><strong>Eligibility for Dominica Citizenship Program</strong></p> <p >Section 101 of the Dominica Constitution and Section 8 and Amendment 20(1) of the Citizenship Act define the investor program in law, legally granting eligible persons instant citizenship in the country by a Certificate of Naturalization. The Dominica Citizenship by Investment Unit (CBIU), a recently established government authority within the Ministry of Finance, enforces all regulations under the passport program and is the regulatory body that ensures only worthy applicants are accepted. In order to be considered eligible, the main applicant must be at least 18 years of age and must meet all the Dominica immigration requirements outlined below.</p> <p ><strong>Clean Background Check</strong></p> <p >The Dominica Economic Citizenship Program will only accept individuals of outstanding character and repute. To ensure only credible persons of impeccable standing are given citizenship, the Government of Dominica has a preeminent private investigative agency perform a comprehensive due diligence procedure on all applicants older than 18 years of age. Dominica is committed to an exemplary standard of due diligence to protect the integrity of its citizenship investment program, and only individuals with <strong>no criminal record</strong> and whose funds have been legally derived will be permitted to acquire citizenship in the country.</p> <p ><strong>Financial Investment</strong></p> <p >To be eligible for Dominican citizenship by investment, a candidate must either make a significant economic contribution to a government fund or purchase approved real estate on the island. In both cases, the applicant must officially commit to making the investment before applying to the investor program, but does not actually have to pay in full until&nbsp;afterapproval in principle.</p> <p ><strong>Government Fund</strong>&nbsp;<br>The Dominica Economic Diversification Fund (EDF) finances public and private sector projects in the country in an effort to increase national development and support the islands social progress and financial security. Public sector projects identified for financing by the fund include renovating the local hospital, building new schools, constructing a national sports stadium, and promoting the Island of Dominica offshore industry. Private sector projects financed by the fund primarily focus on advancing the nation&apos;s information technology, tourism, and agricultural sectors.</p> <p >To qualify for Dominica citizenship by investment under this option, the following non-refundable monetary contributions must be made to the Economic Diversification Fund:<br>Single applicant - USD $100,000<br>Main applicant and spouse - USD $150,000<br>Main applicant, spouse, and up to 2 children - USD $175,000<br>Additional dependents - USD $25,000 each<br>Eligible siblings 18 to 25 - USD $50,000 each</p> <p >These contribution amounts are significantly lower than other citizenship by investment countries in the region with comparable passports. The Dominican Economic Citizenship Program offers astounding value to its participants, and no other reputable investor citizenship program has such affordable investment criteria making Dominica the cheapest citizenship by investment program in the world. The cost to become a Dominica citizen will likely increase substantially in 2021 or 2022, bringing the country&apos;s prices more in line with other Caribbean citizenship programs.</p> <p >Candidates applying under the government donation option must agree to pay the total amount specified by the program within 30 days of receiving an Approval in Principle letter from the CBIU. Until the applicant has passed the due diligence phase and is officially approved in principle, however, they are not required to actually make the contribution. Upon formally receiving conditional CBIU approval, donations are deposited by wire transfer into a designated governmental escrow account at the National Commercial Bank of Dominica. If an application is rejected or withdrawn, the candidate will be refunded the entire deposit amount minus a small application fee within one month of the rejection or withdrawal. If the application is successful, the money will be removed from the escrow account by the Government only after an Oath of Allegiance has been signed before a Notary Public and naturalization certificates as well as passports have been issued to the principal applicant and their family.</p> <p ><strong>Real Estate</strong>&nbsp;<br>Dominica is one of the most beautiful islands in the Caribbean with perfectly unspoiled nature - emerald green mountain sides cascade down to sensational coastlines and the mild Caribbean ocean. The island has 365 rivers, one of the largest thermally active &quot;boiling lakes&quot; in the world, an abundance of exceptional hot springs, and a wealth of coconut trees and bright tropical flowers. As people discover the amazing hiking, diving, bird watching, and other ecotourism activities offered on the volcanically active island, the number of tourists visiting Dominica each year continues to rise. Growing alongside the tourism industry, foreign ownership of real estate in Dominica has increased rapidly over the past few years. Americans are retiring to the country in record numbers, drawn to the islands natural beauty and peaceful way of life, and businessmen and businesswomen from around the globe are strategically investing in Dominica luxury resorts, particularly individuals from China, Russia, and the Middle East.</p> <p >To qualify for Dominican citizenship under the real estate investment option, an applicant must buy <strong>approved</strong> real estate in the country for at least USD $200,000 and maintain ownership for a minimum of three years. If the applicant maintains ownership for five years, they are eligible to re-sell the property under the citizenship by investment program. The following government application fees are due when applying to the Dominica Economic Citizenship Program under the real estate category:<br>Main applicant - USD $25,000<br>Spouse - USD $10,000<br>Family of up to 4 - USD $35,000<br>Family of up to 6 - USD $50,000<br>Family of 7 or more - USD $70,000<br>Additional dependents - USD $25,000 each<br>Eligible siblings 18 to 25 - USD $50,000 each</p> <p >There are several Commonwealth of Dominica citizenship program authorized real estate projects currently under development in the country. One of the most promising is the secluded Cabrits Resort Kempinski by Range Developments, which will be a sensational luxury hotel with astonishing panoramic views of both the ocean and mountains. Another notable Dominica real estate development is the prestigious Tranquility Beach by Sunstone Incorporated, which will be an environmentally-sensitive resort with a world-class spa, wellness center, pool, and restaurant, all located on a gorgeous 4-acre plot of coastal land.</p> <p ><strong>How to Get Dominica Citizenship by Investment</strong></p> <p >The first step towards procuring a Commonwealth of Dominica passport is to contact an Authorized Agent of the Caribbean economic citizenship program. It is not possible to submit an application directly to the Dominica Citizenship by Investment Unit (CBIU) -&nbsp;only authorized CBIU agents can present new citizenship applications under the program. Before an accredited individual or company will accept a new investor client, he or she will customarily perform some basic due diligence on the potential client and will walk them through the entire process from start to finish. If no issues surface during initial due diligence, the investor can retain the services of the agent who will then prepare and submit a citizenship of Dominica by investment application on their behalf. As part of this process, the immigration professional will also handle all auxiliary documentation preparation and validation, and can even arrange the professional translation of foreign language documents into English.</p> <p ><strong>What Family Members Can Be Considered Dependents?</strong></p> <p >According to Dominica Economic Citizenship Program rules, a qualified dependent is:</p> <ul > <li >A spouse of the primary applicant</li> <li >A child of the primary applicant or spouse that is younger than 18 years of age</li> <li >A child of the primary applicant or spouse, fully supported by his or her parents, that is between 18 and 30 years of age and in full-time attendance at a recognized higher learning institution since age 18</li> <li >An unmarried daughter of the primary applicant, living with and fully supported by his or her parent, that is younger than 30 years of age</li> <li >A child of the primary applicant or spouse, fully supported by his or her parents, that is older than 18 years of age and physically or mentally challenged</li> <li >Parents or grandparents of the primary applicant or spouse, living with and fully supported by the primary applicant, that are above the age of 55</li> </ul>
